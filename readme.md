# ðŸ’« About This Repository:
About 40% of car accidents on highways occur due to lack of sleep or drowsiness. This is a major cause for concern on busy highways with heavy vehicles driving at high speeds.
<br>
Thus, our project aims to detect the drowsiness level of a driver in a vehicle by identifying their facial features and using those to detect whether theyâ€™re capable to drive or not.
<br>
This system will be most useful to law enforcement agencies and can be equipped on traffic signals or signboards with a powerful camera or it can also be mounted to the dashboard of a car by the manufacturer to help reduce the possibility of accidents.<br><br>
